  <p>SOUTHGATE &amp; BARRETT have received instructions from MR. HOGARTH,
  of the Haymarket, to Sell by Public Auction at their Fine Art and Book
  Auction Rooms, 22. Fleet Street, London, on Wednesday Evening, June 7th,
  and following Evenings,</p>

<p class="ac">THE WHOLE OF THE REMAINING
COPIES</p>

<p class="ac">Of the very Celebrated Work, known as</p>

<h2>FINDEN'S ROYAL GALLERY OF
BRITISH ART,</h2>

  <p>Consisting of a limited number of Artists' and other choice proofs,
  and the print impressions, which are all in an exceedingly fine state.
  The work consists of 48 plates, the whole of which are engraved in line
  by the most eminent men in that branch of art, and the pictures selected
  will at once show that the great artists&mdash;Turner, Eastlake,
  Landseer, Stanfield, Webster, Roberts, Wilkie, Maclise, Mulready, and
  more than thirty other British Masters, are represented by the works
  which established and upheld them in public favour, and by themes which
  appeal to universal sympathy and happiest affections, or which delineate
  the peculiar glories of our country, and commemorate its worthiest and
  most honourable achievements.</p>

  <p>The attention of the public is also particularly directed to the fact
  that ALL THE ENGRAVED PLATES from which the impressions now offered have
  been taken, WILL BE DESTROYED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PURCHASERS, at the
  time of Sale. By thus securing the market from being supplied with
  inferior impressions at a future time, and at a cheaper rate, the value
  of the existing stock will be increased, and it will become the interest
  of all who wish to possess copies of these eminent works of art, at a
  reduced price, to purchase them at this Sale, which will be THE ONLY
  OPPORTUNITY of obtaining them.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, therefore, SOUTHGATE &amp; BARRETT presume
  to demand for this Sale the attention of all lovers of art&mdash;the
  amateur, the artist, and the public;&mdash;believing that no opportunity
  has ever offered so happily calculated to promote taste and to extend
  knowledge, while ministering to the purest and best enjoyments which the
  artist conveys to the hearts and homes of all who covet intellectual
  pleasures.</p>

  <p>Framed Copies of the work can be seen at MR. HOGARTH'S, 5. Haymarket;
  MESSRS. LLOYD, BROTHERS, &amp; CO., 22. Ludgate Hill; and at the
  AUCTIONEERS, 22. Fleet Street, by whom all Communications and Commissions
  will be promptly and faithfully attended to.</p>

  <p><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> Catalogues of the entire Sale
  will be forwarded on Receipt of 12 Postage Stamps.</p>

<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ST. AUGUSTINE ON CLAIRVOYANCE.</h3>

  <p>Dr. Maitland, in his valuable <i>Illustrations of Mesmerism</i>, has
  not, I think, noticed an important passage in St. Augustine's treatise,
  <i>De Genesi ad litteram</i>, l. <span class="sm">XII.</span> c. 17. §§
  34. <i>seq.</i>, in which, after saying that demons <i>can read men's
  thoughts</i>, and know what is passing at a distance, he proceeds to give
  a detailed account of two cases of <i>clairvoyance</i>. The whole is
  written with his usual graphic power, and will well reward the perusal. I
  must content myself with a brief outline of the facts.</p>

  <p>1. A patient, suffering from a fever, was supposed to be possessed by
  an unclean spirit. Twelve miles off lived a presbyter, with whom, in
  mesmerist phraseology, he was <i>en rapport</i>. He would receive no food
  from any other hands; with him, except when a fit was upon him, he was
  calm and submissive. When the presbyter left his home the patient would
  indicate his position at each stage of his journey, and mark his nearer
  and nearer approach. "He is entering the farm&mdash;the house&mdash;he is
  at the door;" and his visitor stood before him. Once he foretold the
  death of a neighbour, not as though he were predicting a future event,
  but as if recollecting a past. For when she was mentioned in his hearing,
  he exclaimed, "She is dead, I saw her funeral; that way they carried out
  her corpse." In a few days she fell sick and died, and was carried out
  along that very road which he had named.</p>

  <p>2. A boy was labouring under a painful disorder, which the physicians
  had vainly endeavoured to relieve. In the exhaustion which followed on
  his convulsive struggles, he would pass into a trance, keeping his eyes
  open, but insensible to what was going on around him, and passively
  submitting to pinches from the bystanders (<i>ad nullam se vellicationem
  movens</i>). After awhile he awoke and told what he had seen. Generally
  an old man and a youth appeared to him; at the beginning of Lent they
  promised him ease during the forty days, and gave him <i>directions by
  which he might be relieved and finally cured</i>. He followed their
  counsel, with the promised success.</p>

  <p>Augustine's remarks (c. xviii. § 39.) on these and similar phenomena
  are well worth reading. He begs the learned not to mock him as speaking
  confidently, and the unlearned not to take what he says on trust, but
  hopes that both will regard him simply as an inquirer. He compares these
  visions to those in dreams. Some come true, and some false; some are
  clear, others obscure. But men love to search into what is singular,
  neglecting what is usual, though even more inexplicable; just as when a
  man hears a word whose sound is new to him, he is curious to know its
  meaning; while he never thinks of asking the meaning of words familiar to
  his ear, however little he may really understand them. If any one then
  wishes for a satisfactory account of these strange phenomena, let him
  first explain the phenomena of dreams, or let him show how the images of
  material objects reach the mind through the eyes.</p>

<h3>EDWARD GIBBON, FATHER AND SON.</h3>

  <p>Gibbon mentions in his <i>Memoirs</i> (edit. 1796, p. 18.), that in
  1741 his father and Mr. Delmé successfully contested Southampton against
  Mr. Henly, subsequently Lord Chancellor, but that, after the dissolution
  in 1747, he was unable or unwilling to maintain another contest, and "the
  life of the senator expired in that dissolution." Not so the hopes of the
  senator, as will appear from the following extract from a letter, dated
  "Beriton, January 27, 1754:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I received the favour of your letter according to the time you
  promised. As Lord M&mdash;&mdash; has promised his own votes, I find
  there is nothing to be done: strange behaviour, sure! But there seems to
  be such infatuation upon this poor country, that even a good Catholic
  shall join with a Dissenter to rivet on her chains. There are several of
  the Independents would have me stand it out, but I would not on any
  account, for I find it would make great dissensions, and even several of
  Lord M&mdash;&mdash;'s fagots and tenants would vote against him; and
  another thing, it would lessen him in the opinion of a <i>great many
  people</i> to have him making interest for the two <i>present worthy
  candidates</i> against me. I shall therefore, upon his account, give over
  all thoughts of standing; and I hope it may give me some little more
  credit and merit with him against another election, especially if you
  would <i>be so good as to improve it for me</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following is of far greater interest&mdash;full of character. How
  well it illustrates the paragraph in the <i>Memoirs</i> (pp. 82-3.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"My stay at Beriton was always voluntary ... I never handled a gun, I
  seldom mounted a horse; and my philosophic walks were soon terminated by
  a shady bench, where I was long detained by the sedentary amusement of
  reading or meditation."</p>

  <p>It appears however, by this letter, that on one occasion he trespassed
  on some neighbour's game preserves, and received a hint on the
  subject:</p>

  <p>As I am extremely well convinced of your politeness, and your
  readiness to grant your <!-- Page 512 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page512"></a>{512}</span>neighbours any reasonable liberty with
  regard to country sports, so I should be very sorry if either myself or
  my servants had taken any improper ones.</p>

  <p>I am no sportsman, Sir, and was as much tempted this morning by the
  beauty of the day and the pleasure of the ride as by the hopes of any
  sport. I went out, and, neither acquainted with the bounds of the manors
  nor your request to the neighbouring gentlemen, could only follow my
  groom where he led me. I quitted your manor the instant I received your
  message, without having killed anything in it. I assure you that you
  shall never have again the same subject of complaint. With regard to the
  liberty you are so good as to grant me for other sports, I return you my
  most humble thanks, but shall not make much use of it, as there are still
  in my father's manor more game than would satisfy so moderate a sportsman
  as myself.</p>

  <p>My father would be extremely angry if his servants had destroyed any
  of your game; but they all assure him they have killed no one hare upon
  your liberties. As to pheasants, they have only killed one this season,
  and that in Inwood copse.</p>

<h3>BOHN'S "ORDERICUS VITALIS."</h3>

  <p>In looking through the pages of <i>Ordericus Vitalis</i>, vol. ii.
  (Bohn's edition), I have noticed some trifling inaccuracies, to one or
  more of which you will perhaps suffer me to call the editor's attention
  through the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," in case he be not already aware of
  them.</p>

  <p>At p. 70. King William is described as offering the bishopric of Mans
  to "Samson, <i>Bishop</i> of Bayeux, his chaplain." So in the index to
  <i>Histor. Anglic. circa tempus Conquestûs, &amp;c., a Francisco
  Maseres</i>, I find this passage of Vitalis referred to under the title
  of "Sanson Baiocensis <i>episcopus</i>."</p>

  <p>But yet Odo was Bishop of Bayeux at this time; and notwithstanding
  what Marbode <i>afterwards</i> said of Bayeux, when he invited his old
  pupil to meet him there, viz. "Sedes præsulibus sufficit illa tribus,"
  yet Samson, even then, was not Bishop of Bayeux, but of Worcester.</p>

  <p>The original words of Vitalis are, "Sansoni <i>Baiocensi</i>," Samson
  being (temp. Will. I.) Canon and Treasurer of Bayeux, as well as Baron of
  Dover, and Canon of St. Martin's there, Dean of Wolverhampton, and
  chaplain to William. He was a married man, and apparently at the time in
  question only in deacon's orders. One of his sons, at a later period,
  became Bishop of Bayeux, as did also a grandson, whose mother (according
  to Beziers) was "Isabelle de Dovre, maîtresse de Robert Conte de
  Glocester, bâtard de Henri I., Roi d'Angleterre." Upon which I would
  found a Query, viz., Was this grandson of Samson, whose name was Richard,
  an <i>uterine</i> or a <i>half</i> brother of Roger, Bishop of Worcester?
  Both are described as sons of Robert, Earl of Gloucester.</p>

  <p>At p. 261. Alberede is described in the text of the translation to be
  a daughter of "Hugh, Bishop of Evreux," whereas in the original she is
  said to be "Hugonis Bajocensis episcopi filia."</p>

  <p>In a note to this passage we are informed that Hugh, Bishop of
  Lisieux, died at the Council of Rheims (Oct. 1049), and that he was
  eldest son of Ralph, Count d'Ivri &amp;c. On the contrary, we are told at
  p. 428, note 2, that it was Odo's predecessor (<i>i. e.</i> Hugh d'Ivri)
  in the see of Bayeux, who died at the Council of Rheims, Oct. 1049.
  Again, in a note at p. 118, we learn that Hugh d'Eu, who succeeded
  Herbert as Bishop of Lisieux in 1050, or the year following the Council
  in question, did not vacate that see until 1077.</p>

  <p>Before I close this Note, I should be glad to inquire what grounds the
  editor has for asserting (p. 32, n. 1.) that Thomas, Archbishop of York,
  "was not a chaplain to the king" before his promotion. Thierry,
  <i>Histoire de la Conquête, &amp;c.</i> (Par. 1825, tome ii. p. 18.),
  says: "Thomas, l'un des chapelains du roi, fut nommé archevêque d'York."
  And by Godwin (<i>De Præsul. Angl.</i>, tom. ii. p. 244.) we are told
  that Odo&mdash;</p>

<h3>A CURIOUS EXPOSITION.</h3>

  <p>The following curious illustration, which I met with the other day in
  a book where few would be likely to look for it, seems to me fairly to
  deserve a place among the Notes of your interesting publication. It forms
  the <i>moral</i> exposition, by Cornelius à Lapide, of Ex. vii. 22.: "And
  the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments," &amp;c.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"See here," he says, "how the devil contends with God, the magicians
  with the prophets, and heretics with the orthodox, by imitating their
  words and deeds. In our days, as the English Martyrology testifies,
  Richard White (<i>Vitus</i>) disputed with a wicked English Calvinist,
  who was more mighty in drinking than in argument, concerning the keys of
  the Church, and when the heretic pertinaciously asserted that they were
  given to himself, White wittily and ingeniously replied: 'I believe that
  they have been given to you as they were to Peter, but with this
  distinction, that his were the keys of heaven, but yours of the
  beer-cellar; <!-- Page 513 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page513"></a>{513}</span>for this the <i>rubicund promontory of
  your nose</i> indicates.' Thus do heretics turn water into blood. This is
  their miracle."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Richard White I presume to have been an ejected Fellow of New College,
  Oxford, afterwards rector of the University of Douai, and a Count
  Palatine of the empire, author of sundry antiquarian and theological
  works; but it is surely strange that this piece of ribaldry, of which he
  had been guilty, should be thought worthy of being recorded; and still
  more so, that it should be thus applied by a grave and learned Jesuit
  commentator.</p>

  <p>Might not catalogues of these be printed, as well as the more
  historically valuable and curious of the papers themselves? And is there
  any sufficient reason why the earlier portions of the parochial registers

  her husband was not Lord Simon; but he ultimately decided that the lady

<h3>SEPULCHRAL MONUMENTS.</h3>

  <p>As recumbent effigies are in vogue, there are some points connected
  herewith worthy of discussion at the present time in your pages. The
  ultra-admirers of the mediæval monuments will not allow the slightest
  deviation from what they regard as the prescriptive model&mdash;a figure
  with the head straight, and the hands raised in prayer. One of their
  arguments is, that the ancient effigy is alive, while the modern
  modifications are in a state of death, and consequently repulsive to the
  feelings of the spectator. In my opinion, however, the vitality of the
  old ones is very questionable. Let us reflect upon their probable origin.
  In former times the bodies of ecclesiastics and other personages were
  laid in state, exposed to public view, and even carried into the churches
  in that condition: a custom still prevalent abroad. It is reasonable to
  conjecture that the monuments intended to perpetuate this scene in stone,
  imitating the form of the deceased, with the canopy and bier, and adorned
  with armorial bearings and other appropriate devices. Images of wax were
  frequently substituted for the corpse, some of which (among them Queen
  Elizabeth's) are still preserved in Westminster Abbey; but the practice
  was kept up even down to the time of the great Duke of Marlborough. It is
  recorded in history, that during the progress of the body of our Henry V.
  from France, a figure of the king, composed of boiled leather, was placed
  upon the coffin. York Cathedral contains a beautiful example of a
  complete monument of this description in the Early English style, which
  degenerated by degrees into the four-post bed, with its affectionate
  couple, of the Elizabethan period. It is obviously a fair deduction, from
  these circumstances, that the sepulchral effigies are "hearsed in
  death."</p>

  <p>From Mr. Ruskin's <i>Stones of Venice</i>, it appears that the figures
  on the Venetian tombs of the Middle Ages are manifestly dead; and such,
  it may be inferred, is the impression conveyed to his highly cultivated
  mind by the contemplation of those in our own country.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the most elaborate examples," says this observant writer, "the
  canopy is surmounted by a statue, generally small, representing the dead
  person in the full strength and pride of life, while the recumbent figure
  shows him as he lay in death. And at this point the perfect type of the
  Gothic tomb is reached."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Describing one at Verona, of the fourteenth century, he observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The principal aim of the monument is to direct the thoughts to his
  image as he lies in death, and to the expression of his hope of
  resurrection."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And towards the conclusion of his review of their development he
  writes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This statue in the meantime has been gradually coming back to life
  through a curious series of transitions. The Vendramin monument is one of
  the last which shows, or pretends to show, the recumbent figure laid in
  death. A few years later this idea became disagreeable to polite minds;
  and lo! the figures which before had been laid at rest upon the tomb
  pillow, raised themselves on their elbows, and began to look around them.
  The soul of the sixteenth century dared not contemplate its body in
  death."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Flaxman, in his remarks on the monuments of Aylmer de Valence and
  Edmund Crouchback in Westminster Abbey, admires</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The solemn repose of the principal figure, representing the deceased
  in his last prayer for mercy to the throne of grace, the delicacy of
  thought in the group of angels bearing the soul, and the tender sentiment
  of concern variously expressed in the relations ranged in order round the
  basement."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As, however, a canopy on the former exhibits a living figure of the
  departed on horseback, such as Mr. Ruskin notices in Italy, and as the
  angels are said to bear the soul, the knight must certainly have breathed
  his last. The raised hands are no refutation of the argument, since there
  are grounds for the assertion that those of the dead bodies laid in state
  were sometimes tied together to retain them in the suitable position. A
  few exceptional instances, no doubt, occur of variations in the attitude
  irreconcileable with death, and equally inconsistent with a reclining
  posture. It must also be admitted that in brasses and incised slabs
  (which may be regarded in many respects as parallel memorials), the eyes
  are almost invariably unclosed; yet the fact, neither in this case nor in
  that of the carved marble, does not by any means certify that the
  individuals are alive.</p>

  <p>Since then there is so much reason for the supposition that the
  generality of our ancestors are sculptured in the sleep of death, the
  recumbent figure of a Christian clasping the Bible, and slightly turning
  his head, just passed away into another state of existence (not into
  purgatory, <!-- Page 515 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page515"></a>{515}</span>but into a happier world), cannot surely
  be now deemed unsuitable to a Gothic church.</p>

<h3>QUERIES ON SOUTH'S SERMONS.</h3>

  <p>I should be glad to know the authority for the following statement in
  South's sermon, <i>Against long Extempore Prayers</i>, vol. i. p. 251.,
  Tegg's edition, 1843:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These two things are certain, and I do particularly recommend them to
  your observation: One, that this way of praying by the Spirit, as they
  call it, was begun, and first brought into use here in England, in Queen
  Elizabeth's days, by a Popish priest and Dominican friar, one Faithful
  Commin by name. Who, counterfeiting himself a Protestant, and a zealot of
  the highest form, set up this new spiritual way of praying, with a design
  to bring the people first to a contempt, and from thence to an utter
  hatred and disuse of our Common Prayer; which he still reviled as only a
  translation of the mass, thereby to distract men's minds, and to divide
  our Church. And this he did with such success, that we have lived to see
  the effects of his labours in the utter subversion of Church and State;
  which hellish negociation, when this malicious hypocrite came to Rome to
  give the Pope an account of, he received of him, as so notable a service
  well deserved, besides a thousand thanks, two thousand ducats for his
  pains."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Also, who was W. W., the author of "a virulent and insulting pamphlet,
  entitled, <i>A Letter to a Member of Parliament</i>, printed in the year
  1697, and as like the author himself, W. W., as malice can make it,"
  referred to in a note by South at the end of his sermon on <i>The
  Recompence of the Reward</i>, vol. ii. p. 152. Is this pamphlet still in

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Norwich, Kirkpatrick Collection of MSS. for the History
  of.</i>&mdash;Mr. Simon Wilkin, in the preface to the <i>Repertorium</i>,
  contained in his fourth volume of his valuable edition of the works of
  Sir Thomas Browne, p. 4., having spoken of the large collections for the
  History of Norwich made by Mr. John Kirkpatrick, who died in 1728, and
  gave the said collections by will to the mayor, sheriffs, citizens, and
  commonalty of the city of Norwich, in order that "some citizen hereafter,
  being a skilful antiquary, may, from the same, have an opportunity of
  completing and publishing the said history," &amp;c., goes on to say,
  "the MSS. referred to were some years ago in the possession of the
  corporation, but we fear the original intention of the donor has been
  lost sight of, and that these valuable MSS. are for ever lost to the
  lover of local antiquities." This was printed in 1835. But the subject
  ought not to be permitted to drop and rest there. Up to that date, can it
  be ascertained that the papers remained in the keeping of the
  Corporation? Are they still in their hands, though inaccessible? Can any
  information be obtained as to the <i>when</i> and the <i>how</i> they
  passed out of their possession? Or, above all, can any clue be found to
  their subsequent history and present resting-place? It may be suggested
  to any patriotic citizen and antiquary of the fair city of Norwich, that,
  inasmuch as the Corporation, by the terms of the will, are only
  <i>trustees</i> for the property, the Court of Chancery might be moved to
  assist in the recovery thereof.</p>

  <p>[There is the best authority for this assertion, even that of the

  <i>Irishmen</i> and Welshmen that followed the host on foot." The French
  historian also informs us, that the skene or knife was the chief weapon

  <p><i>King of the Isle of Wight.</i>&mdash;I was not aware that the Isle

  be able to throw some light on this matter.</p>

  <p class="author">E. H. A.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Henry Beauchamp, Duke of Warwick, son of Richard Earl of Warwick, was
  crowned King of the Isle of Wight by patent 24 Henry VI., King Henry in
  person assisting at the ceremonial, and placing the crown on his head.
  Leland (<i>Itiner.</i>, vol. vi. p. 91.) says, "Henricus Comes de Warwike
  ab Henrico VI. cui carissimus erat, coronatus <i>in regem de Wighte</i>,
  et postea nominatus primus comes totius Angliæ." Leland takes this <i>ex
  Libello de Antiquitate Theoksibriensis Monasterii</i>, in the church of
  which house this Duke of Warwick was buried. But little notice has been
  taken of this singular event by our historians, and, except for some
  other collateral evidence, the authenticity of it might be doubted; but
  the representation of this duke with an imperial crown on his head and a
  sceptre before him, in an ancient window of the collegiate church at
  Warwick, leaves no doubt that such an event did take place. (See
  Worsley's <i>Hist. of the Isle of Wight</i> for a plate copied from an
  accurate drawing of the king.) This honourable mark of the royal favour,
  however, conveyed no regal authority, the king having no power to
  transfer the sovereignty of any part of his dominions, as is observed by
  Lord Coke in his <i>Institutes</i>, where this transaction is discussed;
  and there is reason to conclude that, though titular king, he did not
  even possess the lordship of the island, no surrender appearing from Duke
  Humphrey, who was then living, and had a grant for the term of his life.
  Mr. Selden too, in his <i>Titles of Honour</i>, p. 29., treating of the
  title of the King of Man, observes that "it was like that of King of the
  Isle of Wight, in the great Beauchamp, Duke of Warwick, who was crowned
  king under Henry VI." Henry Beauchamp was also crowned King of Guernsey
  and Jersey. He died soon after these honours had been conferred on him,
  June 11, 1445, when the regal title expired with him, and the lordship of
  the island, at the death of the Duke of Gloucester, reverted to the
  crown.]</p>

  <p>[The Rev. Nathaniel Ward was the author of this work. He was born at
  Haverhill in Essex, of which place his father was a clergyman; and after
  studying at Cambridge, became minister of Standon in Herts; but was cited
  before the bishop, Dec. 12, 1631, to answer for his nonconformity. Being
  forbidden to preach, he embarked for America in April, 1634, and settled
  as pastor of the church at Ipswich, or Aggawam. He returned to England in
  1646, and on June 30, 1647, preached before the House of Commons, and the
  same year published <i>The Simple Cobler</i>. He was afterwards settled
  at Shenfield, near Brentwood, where he died in 1653, in his eighty-third
  year. Fuller, in his <i>Worthies</i>, co. Suffolk, speaking of him, says,
  that he, "following the counsel of the poet,</p>

  of St. Stephen and its dependent parish, and the buildings between the
  Back and the quay, seem to have taken their rise at this period, and were

<h3>LORD ROSEHILL.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 422.)</p>

  <p>Something more than a partiality for the novelist takes me now and
  then to the scene of the antiquary&mdash;Aberbrothock, or Arbroath. On
  one occasion, in company with a few friends, we made a day of it in a
  ramble along the romantic eastern coast of that burgh, and the scene of
  the perilous incident related of Sir Arthur Lekiss Wardour, when rescued
  from the incoming tide by being drawn up the face of the precipitous
  cliff by the doughty Mucklebacket, under the superintendence of Oldbuck
  and young Lovel. The fresh breeze from the German Ocean, and the
  excitement of the occasion, imparted a keen relish for the locality and
  its associations; and by the time we reached the hostelry of Mrs. Walker,
  at Auchmithie, a no less sharp appreciation of the <i>piscatorial
  spread</i> we had the foresight to bespeak the previous day. Ushered into
  Lucky Walker's best dining-room, our attention was immediately drawn to
  an aristocratic emblazonment of arms which occupied one entire side of
  the room, with a ribbon, artistically disposed over the same, upon which
  was inscribed Lord Rosehill, who was, we were informed, the eldest son of
  the Earl of Northesk (Carnegie), a great proprietor in that
  neighbourhood, and the special patron of our hostess and her
  establishment.</p>

  <p>With respect to the particular Lord Rosehill, alluded to by your
  correspondent W. D. R., I beg to offer him the following brief notice
  from Douglas' <i>Peerage</i>, by Wood, Edin. 1813:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"David L. Rosehill (son of Geo. 6th E. of Northesk) was born at Edin.,
  5th April, 1749; had an Ensign's commission in the 26th Reg. Foot in
  1765; quitted the army 1767, and went to America. He married in Maryland,
  in Aug. 1768, Miss Mary Cheer, and died without issue at Rouen, in
  Normandy, 19 Feb. 1788, æt. 39."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From a dear old lady, whom I always find a mine of Forfarshire
  anecdote of the last century, I obtain some corroborative proof that the
  said David <!-- Page 520 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page520"></a>{520}</span>Lord Rosehill was the eccentric character
  we might infer from the above, in the assurance that he was "a ne'er do
  weel, and ran away with the tincklers (<i>i. e.</i> gypsies) in early
  life."</p>

  <p>If I may farther travel out of the record, allow me here to recommend
  to such of your readers as meditate the northern tour this summer, to
  diverge a little from the beaten track, and visit the neighbourhood above
  alluded to; your antiquarian friends, especially, will be delighted with
  that fine old ruin, the Abbey of Aberbrothock, now that it is brushed up
  and fit to receive visitors. The worthy Mr. Peter, in charge, has some
  curious relics acquired at the last diggins, and possesses a fragment of
  a black-letter Chronicle to satisfy the incredulous that in identifying
  the objects exhibited, he has his warrant in Hector Boece. The man of
  progress, too, will find in Fairport, or Arbroath, a hive of industry;
  but, I regret to add, threatened with a check by this closing of the
  Baltic trade, which is, if I may say so, both <i>woof</i> and <i>warp</i>
  in the prosperity of this and other towns on the east coast of Scotland.
  And lastly, the lovers of ocean, rocks, and caves, will be not less
  interested with the environs, and I doubt not all would leave it
  exclaiming with Johnson, that if they had seen no more of old Scotia than
  Aberbrothock, they would not have regretted their journey.</p>

<h3>MAJOR ANDRÉ.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 111.)</p>

  <p>On the 13th of January, 1817, Mr. Chappell made a report unfavourable
  to the petition of John Paulding (one of the citizens who captured Major
  André), who prays for an increase of the pension allowed to him by the
  government in consequence of that service. On the question to reverse
  this report, an interesting debate followed.</p>

  <p>We copy the following from the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, January
  14, 1817:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"What gave interest principally to the debate, was the disclosure by
  Mr. Tallmadge of Connecticut (an officer at the time, and commanding the
  advance guard when Major André was brought in) of his view of the merit
  of this transaction, with which history and the records of the country
  have made every man familiar. The value of the service he did not deny;
  but on the authority of the declaration of Major André (made while in the
  custody of Colonel Tallmadge), he gave it as his opinion that, if Major
  André could have given to these men the amount they demanded for his
  release, he never would have been hung as a spy, nor in captivity on that
  occasion. Mr. T.'s statement was minutely circumstantial, and given with
  expressions of his individual confidence in its correctness. Among other
  circumstances he stated, that when Major André's boots were taken off by
  them, it was to search for plunder, and not to detect treason. These
  persons, indeed, he said, were of that class of people who passed between
  both armies, as often in one camp as the other, and whom, he said, if he
  had met with them, he should probably as soon have apprehended as Major
  André, as he had always made it a rule to do with these suspicious
  persons. The conclusion to be drawn from the whole of Mr. Tallmadge's
  statement, of which this is a brief abstract, was, that these persons had
  brought in Major André only because they should probably get more for his
  apprehension than for his release."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The question on reversing the report was decided in the
  negative:&mdash;Ayes, 53; Noes, 80 or 90.</p>

  <p>It is proper to say that the question was decided on the ground taken
  in the report, viz. on the injustice of legislating on a single case of
  pension, whilst there were many survivors of the Revolution whom the
  favour of the government had not distinguished.</p>

  <p>From <i>The Gleaner</i>, published at Wilkesbury, Pennsylvania (copied
  into the <i>National Intelligencer</i> of Washington, March 4, 1817):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The disclosure recently made by Colonel Tallmadge in the House of
  Representatives, relative to the capture of Major André, seems to have
  been received in every instance with the confidence to which it was
  certainly entitled. That gentleman related what he saw and knew; and
  those who are attempting to dispute him, relate only what they had been
  informed of. To those of our readers who may not have seen the report of
  Colonel Tallmadge's remarks, it may be proper to observe, that those
  three men who captured Major André, applied to Congress for an increase
  of pension settled on them by the government, and that when this
  application was under consideration, Colonel Tallmadge (a member for
  Connecticut) rose and stated, that having been the officer to whom the
  care of André was entrusted, he had heard André declare that those men
  robbed him, and upon his offer to reward them for taking him to the
  British lines, he believes they declined only from the impossibility of
  giving them sufficient security, &amp;c., and that it was not patriotism
  but the hope of gain which induced them to deliver him to the Americans.
  To this declaration of Colonel Tallmadge, and in support of his opinion,
  we are happy to have it in our power to offer the following corroborating
  testimony.</p>

  <p>"There is now living in this town a gentleman who was an officer in
  the Massachusets line, and who was particularly conversant in all the
  circumstances of that transaction. It was this gentleman who, in company
  with Captain Hughes, composed the special guard of André's person, was
  with him during the last twenty-four hours of his life, and supported him
  to the place of execution. From him we have received the following
  particulars: it is needless to say we give them our implicit belief,
  since to those who are acquainted with the person to whom we allude, no
  other testimony is ever necessary than his simple declaration.</p>

  <p>"To this gentleman André himself related that he was passing down a
  hill, at the foot of which, under a tree, playing cards, were the three
  men who took him. <!-- Page 521 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page521"></a>{521}</span>They were close by the road side, and he
  had approached very near them before either party discovered the other;
  upon seeing him they instantly rose and seized their rifles. They
  approached him and demanded who he was; he immediately answered that he
  was a British officer, supposing, from their being so near the British
  lines, that they belonged to that party. They then seized him, robbed him
  of the few guineas which he had with him, and the two watches which he
  then wore, one of gold and the other of silver. He offered to reward them
  if they would take him to New York; they hesitated, and in his (André's)
  opinion, the reason why they did not do so, was the impossibility on his
  part to secure to them the performance of the promise.</p>

  <p>"He informs also that it was an opinion too prevalent to admit of any
  doubt, that these men were of that description of persons called 'cow
  boys,' or those who, without being considered as belonging to either
  party, made it a business to pillage from both. He has frequently heard
  this opinion expressed at that time by several officers who were
  personally acquainted with all these men, and who could not have been
  mistaken in their general characters.</p>

  <p>"André frequently spoke of the kindness of the American officers, and
  particularly of the attention of Major Tallmadge; and on the way to the
  place of execution sent for that officer to come near him, that he might
  learn the manner in which he was to die."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Statement of Van Wart (from the <i>National Intelligencer</i> of Feb.
  25, 1817):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Isaac Van Wart, of the town of Mount Pleasant, in the county of
  Westchester, being duly sworn, doth depose and say, that he is one of the
  three persons who arrested Major André during the American revolutionary
  war, and conducted him to the American camp. That he, this deponent,
  together with David Williams and John Paulding, had secreted themselves
  at the side of the highway, for the purpose of detecting any person
  coming from, or having unlawful intercourse with, the enemy, being
  between the two armies; a service not uncommon in those times. That this
  deponent and his companions were armed with muskets, and upon seeing
  Major André approach the place where they were concealed, they rose and
  presented their muskets at him, and required him to stop, which he did.
  He then asked them whether they belonged to his party, and then they
  asked him which was his party? to which he replied the lower party. Upon
  which they, deeming a little stratagem under such circumstances not only
  justifiable but necessary, gave him to understand that they were of his
  party, upon which he joyfully declared himself to be a British officer,
  and told them that he had been out upon very particular business. Having
  ascertained thus much, this deponent and his companions undeceived him as
  to their characters, declaring themselves to be Americans, and that he
  must consider himself their prisoner. Upon this, with seeming unconcern,
  he said he had a pass from General Arnold, which he exhibited, and then
  insisted on their permitting him to proceed. But they told him that, as
  he had confessed himself to be a British officer, they deemed it to be
  their duty to convey him to the American camp; and then took him into a
  wood, a short distance from the highway, in order to guard against being
  surprised by parties of the enemy, who were frequently reconnoitering in
  that neighbourhood. That when they had him in the wood they proceeded to
  search him, for the purpose of ascertaining who and what he was, and
  found inside of his stockings and boots, next to his bare feet, papers
  which satisfied them he was a spy. Major André now showed them his gold
  watch, and remarked that it was evidence of his being a gentleman, and
  also promised to make them any reward they might name, if they would but
  permit him to proceed, which they refused. He then told them that if they
  doubted the fulfilment of his promise, they might conceal him in some
  secret place, and keep him there until they could send to New York and
  receive their reward. And this deponent expressly declares, that every
  offer made by Major André to them was promptly and resolutely refused.
  And, for himself, he solemnly declares that he had not, and he does most
  sincerely believe that Paulding and Williams had not, any intention of
  plundering their prisoner; nor did they confer with each other, or even
  hesitate whether they should accept his promise, but, on the contrary,
  they were, in the opinion of this deponent, governed, like himself, by a
  deep interest in the cause of the country, and a strong sense of duty.
  And this deponent further says that he never visited the British camp,
  nor does he believe or suspect that either Paulding or Williams ever did,
  except that Paulding was, once before André's capture, and once
  afterwards, made a prisoner by the British, as this deponent has been
  informed and believes. And this deponent, for himself, expressly denies
  that he ever held any unlawful traffic or any intercourse whatever with
  the enemy. And, appealing solemnly to that omniscient Being, at whose
  tribunal he must soon appear, he doth expressly declare that all
  accusations, charging him therewith, are utterly untrue.</p>

<h3>THE TERMINATIONS "-BY" AND "-NESS."</h3>

  <p>The linguistic origin of these descriptive syllables, when found as
  suffixes to the names of places, is a question of some interest to the
  antiquary and ethnologist; and, as to the former of them, has, on that
  account, fitly enough been made the subject of occasional discussion in
  the pages of "N. &amp; Q." The <i><span class="nw">-by</span></i>, as
  your pages evince (Vol. vii., p. 536.), is implicitly relied upon by Mr.
  Worsaae and his disciples, in support of the Danish theory of that
  eminent northern scholar; and that too, as it appears, without any very
  minute regard to the etymology and meaning of the former syllabic
  divisions of proper names so characterised. If only the designation of a
  locality end with <i><span class="nw">-by</span></i>, evidence sufficient
  is given, that it owes its paternity specially to the Danes alone, of all
  the Scandinavian tribes who obtained a permanent footing on our shores.
  The same is the case with respect to the termination <i><span
  class="nw">-ness</span></i>, and its orthographic varieties. As with the
  Ashbys, Newbys, and Kirbys of our several counties, so (<i>inter
  alia</i>) with the Hackness of Yorkshire, the Longness of Man, the
  Bowness of Westmoreland, and the Foulness of Essex. All have the Danish
  mark upon them; and all, therefore, possess a Danish original, and bear
  witness of a Danish location.</p>

  <p>With regard to the <i>-by</i>, I have already, in these pages, taken
  occasion to suggest a doubt whether, in that particular instance, the
  Worsaaen theory be not as fallacious as it is dogmatical. And, adopting
  the same method with the <i><span class="nw">-ness</span></i>, I think it
  will be evident, on examination of the following list of almost identical
  forms of the expression, that, as to this point also, no argument can be
  founded upon it, one way or the other, beyond the fact of its derivation
  from some of the Scandinavian tribes who, in the fifth and succeeding
  centuries, established themselves on our shores: if, indeed, I do not,
  even with this enlarged extension, assign to the presence of the term in
  our topography a too restricted application.</p>

  <p>Our termination <i>-ness</i>, then, is the old northern or Icelandic
  <i>nes</i>, the parent of the Dan. <i>næs</i>, and the Ang.-Sax.
  <i>nese</i> and <i>næs</i>, signifying "a neck of land, or promontory."
  From this <i>nes</i> came, naturally enough, the old northern <i>naos</i>
  or <i>nös</i>, whence the Dan. <i>næse</i>, the Germ. <i>nase</i>; the
  Ang.-Sax. <i>nase</i>, <i>næse</i>, <i>nose</i>; the Norman-Fr.
  <i>naz</i>, and Su.-Goth. <i>naese</i> (in Al. and Sansc. <i>nasa</i>,
  and in Gall. <i>nes</i>); the Latin <i>nasus</i>, and Eng. <i>nose</i>,
  or <i>nase</i> as it is spelt by Gower in his <i>Conf. Am.</i> b. v.,
  "Both at mouth and at <i>nase</i>." Closely akin to the same word, and
  probably derived from an identical source, is the old northern
  <i>nef</i>, whence were formed the Vulg.-Isl. <i>nebbi</i>, the Dan.
  <i>neb</i>, and the Ang.-Sax. <i>nebbe</i> and <i>neb</i> (in Pers.
  <i>anef</i>; in C. Tscherh. <i>ep</i>, in Curd. <i>defin</i>), the beak
  or bill, the <i>neb</i> or <i>nib</i> of a bird; and also used of the
  prominent feature of the human face divine, to which the term is applied
  by Shakspeare and Bacon, as it is occasionally at the present day by the
  older inhabitants of the Yorkshire dales.</p>

  <p>Thus have we the origin of our <i>nase</i>, <i><span

  <i><span class="nw">-nib</span></i>, <i><span class="nw">-nab</span></i>,

<h3>NEWSPAPER FOLK LORE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 221. 338. 466.; Vol. ix., pp. 29. 84. 276)</p>

  <p>Is it quite certain that "no animal can live in the alimentary canal
  but the parasites which belong to that part of the animal economy?" Being
  ignorant of the matter I give no opinion, but would bring before your
  readers' notice the following seemingly well-authenticated instance. I
  quote from <i>Insect Transformations</i>, 1830, p. 239., a work put forth
  by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That insects are, in some rare cases, introduced into the human
  stomach, has been more than once proved, though the greater number of the
  accounts of such facts in medical books are too inaccurate to be
  trusted.<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> But
  one extraordinary case has been completely authenticated, both by medical
  men and competent naturalists, and is published in the <i>Dublin
  Transactions</i>, by Dr. Pickells of Cork.<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Mary Riordan, aged twenty-eight, had
  been much affected by the death of her mother, and at one of her many
  visits to the grave seems to have partially lost her senses, having been
  found lying there on the morning of a winter's day, and having been
  exposed to heavy rain during the night. When she was about fifteen, two
  popular Catholic priests had died, and she was told by some old women
  that if she would drink daily, for a certain time, a quantity of water
  mixed with clay taken from their graves, she would be for ever secure
  from disease and sin. Following this absurd and disgusting prescription,
  she took from time to time large quantities of the draught; some time
  afterwards, being affected with a burning pain in the stomach
  (cardialgia), she began to eat large pieces of chalk, which she sometimes
  also mixed with water and drank.</p>

  <p>"Now, whether in any or in all these draughts she swallowed the eggs
  of insects, cannot be affirmed; but for several years she continued to
  throw up incredible numbers of grubs and maggots, chiefly of the
  churchyard beetle (<i>Blaps mortisaga</i>). 'Of the larvæ of the beetle,'
  says Dr. Pickells, 'I am sure I considerably underrate, when I say that
  not less than 700 have been thrown up from the stomach at different times
  since the commencement of my attendance. A great proportion were
  destroyed by herself to avoid publicity; many, too, escaped immediately
  by running into holes in the floor. Upwards of ninety were submitted to
  Dr. Thomson's examination; nearly all of which, including two of the
  specimens of the meal-worm (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>), I saw myself thrown
  up at different times. The average size was about an inch and a half in
  length, and four lines and a half in girth. The larvæe of the dipterous
  insect, though voided only about seven or eight times, according to her
  account, came up almost literally in myriads. They were alive and
  moving.' Altogether, Dr. Pickells saw nearly 2,000 grubs of the beetle,
  and there were <!-- Page 524 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page524"></a>{524}</span>many which he did not see. Mr. Clear, an
  intelligent entomologist of Cork, kept some of them alive for more than
  twelve months. Mr. S. Cooper cannot understand whence the continued
  supply of the grubs was provided, seeing that larvæ do not propagate, and
  that only one pupa and one perfect insect were voided<a
  name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>; but the simple
  fact, that most beetles live several years in the state of larvæ,
  sufficiently accounts for this. Their existing and thriving in the
  stomach, too, will appear the less wonderful from the fact that it is
  exceedingly difficult to kill this insect; for Mr. Henry Baker repeatedly
  plunged one into spirits of wine, so fatal to most insects, but it
  revived, even after being immersed a whole night, and afterwards lived
  three years.<a name="footnotetag6"
  href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"That there was no deception on the part of the woman, is proved by
  the fact that she was always anxious to conceal the circumstance; and
  that it was only by accident that the medical gentlemen, Drs. Pickells,
  Herrick, and Thomson, discovered it. Moreover, it does not appear that,
  though poor, she ever took advantage of it to extort money. It is
  interesting to learn that, by means of turpentine in large doses, she was
  at length cured."</p>

<h3>VENTILATION.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 415.)</p>

<p class="ac">"Airs from heaven or blasts from hell."</p>

  <p>The mistake which, it is very respectfully submitted, the professed
  ventilationists fall into, and which may be considered the <i>fons et
  origo malorum</i>, is the notion that foul air rises upwards, and that
  pure air comes from below; which is just the reverse of the fact.</p>

  <p>In any room containing animals or vegetables, the air undergoes a
  change by respiration.</p>

  <p>Leaving the vegetables to care for themselves, and considering the
  animals, if such a title may be reverently given to members of the House
  and others shut up in confined apartments for the benefit of their
  species, it is obvious that the pure air of heaven must undergo a change
  by the respiratory organs of the members, which change is absolutely
  necessary to preserve their lives, and each such apartment is a
  manufactory for converting pure into foul air. Its steam-power is seated
  in the lungs, which, at each inspiration, take up the oxygen (the
  principle of life and flame) of the air, and at each expiration give out
  the carbon of the blood, conveyed by the veins from all parts of the body
  as refuse, and when purged therefrom by oxygen inspired, convert the
  venous blood into arterial, and bring life out of death.</p>

  <p>What, then, becomes of the expired carbon? The professional
  ventilationists say it <i>ascends</i>, and they provide mechanically, but
  not scientifically, accordingly. On the contrary, it finally
  <i>descends</i>; and this is the reason why our beds are always a few
  feet above the floor. If proof is needed, it may be found by applying a
  candle to the door, slightly ajar, of a room occupied by a few persons,
  when it will be found that the flame of the candle will point, when held
  at the lower part of the door, outwards, and at the upper part of the
  door inwards, showing how the currents of air pass; and as every one
  knows carbon to be heavier than air, the lower current is the one charged
  with carbon. The <i>Grotto del Cane</i> derives its name from the fact,
  that a dog passing the stream of carbon issuing from the fissure in the
  rock, dies; whilst a man walking erect, with his mouth above the stream
  of carbon, escapes. Our lime-kilns furnish a common example of the fact
  of the density of carbon compared with atmospheric air. Experiments in
  proof are constantly exhibited in chemical lectures.</p>

  <p>The practical inference, <i>experto crede</i>, is that holes in the
  skirting-boards should be made so as to draw off the foul air, whilst the
  angelic visits of pure air should be sought from above. Bellows, such as
  are used in diving-bells, with hot or cold air, might be necessary in an
  extreme case&mdash;long debates in the Commons, for example,&mdash;which
  may require extraordinary ventilation.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>History of Photographic Discovery.</i>&mdash;Without entirely
  agreeing with the opinion expressed to us a few days since, by an eminent
  scholar and most original thinker, that photography was destined to
  change the face of the whole world; we have little doubt it is destined
  to produce some striking social effects. Its history is, therefore, an
  interesting one, and the following extract from a paper "On some early
  Experiments in Photography, being the substance of a Letter addressed to
  Robert Hunt, Esq., by the Rev. J. B. Reade, M.A., F.R.S.," from the
  <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> for May, 1854, seems, in that point of
  view, so important, that we have transferred it to "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p>"I may assume that you are already aware, from my letter to Mr.
  Brayley of March 9, 1839, and published in the <i>British Review</i> for
  August, 1847, that the principal agents I employed, before Mr. Talbot's
  processes were known, were infusion of galls as an accelerator, and
  hyposulphite of soda as a fixer.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt, though I have not a distinct recollection of the
  fact, that I was led to use the infusion of galls from my knowledge of
  the early experiments by Wedgwood. I was aware that he found
  <i>leather</i> more sensitive than <i>paper</i>; and it is highly
  probable that the tanning process, which might cause the silver <!-- Page
  525 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page525"></a>{525}</span>solution
  to be more readily acted upon when applied to the leather, suggested my
  application of the tanning solution to paper.</p>

  <p>"In your own history of the photographic process," says Mr. Reade,
  addressing Mr. Hunt, "you say, 'the discovery of the extraordinary
  property of the gallic acid in increasing the sensibility of the iodide
  of silver was the most valuable of the numerous contributions which Mr.
  Talbot has made to the photographic art.' It is nevertheless true, as
  stated by Sir David Brewster, that 'the first public use of the infusion
  of nut-galls, which is an <i>essential element</i> in Mr. Talbot's
  patented process, is due to Mr. Reade;' and in my letter to Mr. Brayley I
  attribute the sensitiveness of my process to the formation of a gallate
  or tannate of silver. I need scarcely say, that among various experiments
  I tried gallic and tannic acid in their pure state, both separately and
  mixed; but the colour of the pictures thus obtained with the solar
  microscope was at that time less pleasing to my eye, than the rich warm
  tone which the same acids produced when in their natural connexion with
  solutions of vegetable matter in the gall-nut. This organic combination,
  however, was more effective with the solar microscope than with the
  camera, though the lenses of my camera were five inches in diameter. It
  is probable enough that the richer tone was due to the greater energy of
  direct solar rays. In using the solar microscope, I employed a
  combination of lenses which produced a convergence of the luminous and
  photogenic rays, together with a dispersion of the calorific rays, and
  the consequent absence of all sensible heat enabled me to use Ross's
  cemented powers, and to make drawings of objects inclosed in Canada
  balsam, and of living animalcules in single drops of water. The method I
  employed was communicated to the Royal Society in December, 1836, and a
  notice of it is contained in the 'Abstracts.'</p>

  <p>"You inform me that some persons doubt whether I really obtain
  <i>gallate of silver</i> when using an infusion of gall-nuts, and that
  one of Mr. Talbot's friends raises the question. It is sufficient to
  reply, that though gallic acid is largely formed by a long exposure of an
  infusion of gall-nuts to the atmosphere, as first proposed by Scheele,
  yet this acid does exist in the gall-nut in its natural state, and in a
  sufficient quantity to form gallate of silver as a photogenic agent; for
  M. Deyeux observes, that 'when heat is very slowly applied to powdered
  gall-nuts, gallic acid sublimes from them, a part of which, when the
  process is conducted with great care, appears in the form of small white
  crystals.' M. Fiedler also obtained gallic acid by mixing together a
  solution of gall-nuts and pure alumina, which latter combines with the
  tannin and leaves the gallic acid free in the solution; and this solution
  is found, on experiment, to produce very admirable pictures. But what is
  more to the point, Mr. Brayley, in explaining my process in his lectures,
  showed experimentally how gallate of silver was formed, and confirmed my
  view of the sensitiveness of the preparation. It is therefore certain
  that the use of gallate of silver as a photogenic agent had been made
  public in two lectures by Mr. Brayley at least two years before Mr.
  Talbot's patent was sealed.</p>

  <p>"I employed hyposulphite of soda as a fixer. Mr. Hodgson, an able
  practical chemist at Apothecaries' Hall, assisted me in the preparation
  of this salt, which at that time was probably not be found, as an article
  of sale, in any chemist's shop in London. Sir John Herschel had
  previously announced the peculiar action of this preparation of soda on
  salts of silver, but I believe that I was the first to use it in the
  processes of photography. I also used iodide of potassium, as appears
  from my letter, as a fixer, and I employed it as well to form iodide of
  lead on glazed cards as an accelerator. Iodide of lead has of itself, as
  I form it, considerable photographic properties, and receives very fair
  impressions of plants, lace, and drawings when placed upon it, but with
  the addition of nitrate of silver and the infusion of galls the operation
  is perfect and instantaneous. Pictures thus taken were exhibited at the
  Royal Society before Mr. Talbot proposed his iodized paper. The
  microscopic photographs exhibited at Lord Northampton's in 1839 remained
  in his lordship's possession. I subsequently made drawings of sections of
  teeth; and one of them, a longitudinal section of a tooth of the
  <i>Lamna</i>, was copied on zinc by Mr. Lens Aldous for Owen's
  'Odontography.' I may say this much as to my own approximation to an art,
  which has deservedly and by universal consent obtained the name of
  Talbotype."</p>

  <p><i>Photographic Cautions.</i>&mdash;Diffused light being one of the
  most common causes of photographic failures, I beg to call the attention
  of your readers to the construction of their cameras. Working with a
  friend, and taking the same localities, using the same paper and
  chemicals, his pictures have proved comparative failures, a general
  browning pervading the whole, evidently the effect of light. Every
  inspection failed to discover it, until the mode was adopted of putting
  one of the paper-holders in its position as for taking a picture, then
  removing the lens, and, with the aid of the focussing-bag, looking
  through the hole where the lens is applied, when light became visible in
  many spaces, entirely accounting for these failures. As many such cameras
  are now becoming made upon the same sliding construction, every one
  should test his apparatus before he commences, for such a one is entirely
  useless. Lately also the glass corners for collodion plate-holders in the
  dark slides, have been by some makers replaced by a sort of silver
  <i>looking</i> wire, but possessing little of that metal. The most minute
  portion of the copper in this wire coming in contact with the excited
  collodion, produces a decomposition sufficient to spoil any picture.
  These may appear trivial things to "make a note of," but as they have
  caused much vexation to one who has had some photographic experience,
  they may still more perplex a novice; and as you have done so much
  towards making the science plain, I hope you will give them space in your
  forthcoming Number.</p>

  <p><i>A Query respecting Collodion.</i>&mdash;I have been making some
  collodion by Mr. Tery's process, and have iodized it with a very
  sensitive medium. The collodion is very clear and properly diluted. The
  ether I used had a very powerful smell of sulphur, and was likewise very
  strong and volatile. I diluted it with an equal <!-- Page 526 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page526"></a>{526}</span>volume of alcohol. The
  ether was then still very strong. The cotton dissolved freely. On mixing
  the iodizing medium, the colour of the collodion turns immediately to
  nearly a port-wine colour, but still remains very clear. I obtain a very
  good film of iodide of silver from the bath, but cannot produce a picture
  under five or seven minutes, whereas with the same lens, and the same
  iodizing medium, viz.</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> Alcohol</td>
<td> 8 drms.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr2"> Iodide of potassium</td>
<td> 8 grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Iodide of ammonium</td>
<td> 4 grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Iodide of silver</td>
<td> ½ gr.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>I have obtained beautiful pictures in less than one second with
  collodion prepared by the same (Archer's) process. As I have made a
  quantity of it, and am unwilling it should be wasted, I have taken the
  liberty of asking your opinion on the subject. Do you think the collodion
  is too new, or the ether not good? On pouring the developing solution on
  the plate (protosulphate of iron), the plate has the appearance of having
  ink poured on it; but this appearance is removed on the application of
  the hyposulphite of soda, and the plate remains as clear as when it was
  taken from the nitrate of silver bath.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Fox Talbot's Patents.</i>&mdash;-The injunction moved for by
  Mr. Fox Talbot, as reported in <i>The Times</i> of Saturday last, reminds
  us of a Query which we have been sometimes asked, and which may just now
  be brought forward with advantage, namely: If Mr. Talbot's patents extend
  to the collodion process, how comes it that the earliest practisers of
  the collodion art had to make their own researches? We know one skilful
  photographer whose experiments were so extensive before he made any
  tolerable pictures, that his spoiled glass and cuttings were more than a
  man could lift.</p>

  <p><i>The Olympic Plain</i> (Vol. ix., p. 270.).&mdash;I have just seen,
  in examining the contents of a German periodical, that in May, 1853, a
  proposal was submitted to the public by Professor Ross, of the University
  of Halle, for setting on foot a subscription to defray the expense of
  making excavations in Olympia, thus anticipating, by nearly a year, a
  recent suggestion to the same effect in "N. &amp; Q." Professor Ross
  expatiates at considerable length (see <i>Jahrbücher für Philologie und
  Pädagogik</i>, vol. lxviii. p. 203.) on the advantages to be derived, as
  regards the arts, the literature, and the history of Greece, from the
  exploration of so celebrated a spot; but, notwithstanding all his
  arguments and eloquence, the amount of the subscriptions, after the lapse
  of nine months, only amounted, in February, 1854, to about 38<i>l.</i> As
  this sum was so utterly inadequate for the object intended, it was
  resolved to devote it to excavations in Mykenæ. Professor Ross takes
  occasion to pay a high tribute of praise to Lord Aberdeen, for the
  service rendered by his Lordship in discovering the treasury at Mykenæ.
  The facilities at Olympia for carrying on excavations are stated by
  Professor Ross to be very great. It is but a few miles distant from the
  sea, on the banks of a navigable river, and opposite to the very populous
  island of Zante; so that workmen, and means, and helps of all kinds can
  easily be procured. It was intended to give the superintendence of the
  excavations to Professor Alexander Rizo Rangabe, of the University of
  Athens, who was to be supplied with an adequate staff of artists, &amp;c.
  Whatever discoveries might be made, were to become the property of the
  Greek nation. Travellers were to be permitted to visit the excavations
  during their progress, and to see all that was going on; and it was
  thought that a considerable number might be attracted to the spot, as the
  Austrian steamers convey passengers weekly in three or four days from
  Trieste to the western coast of the Morea.</p>

  <p><i>Chapel Sunday</i> (Vol. vii., p. 527.).&mdash;Not having received

  in the Lake district, I would venture a surmise which some Cumbrian
  antiquary will perhaps correct, if wrong. I take it to be the day in
  honour of the patron saint of the chapel: and now, when such festivals
  are little observed, it has been changed to the nearest Sunday. In this
  thinly populated district, and where, from its mountainous and rugged
  character, travelling before the formation of the present good roads was
  neither agreeable nor (probably) safe, "at chapel" was the only time many
  of the inhabitants saw each other. Meeting, therefore, on so auspicious a
  day as that of the patron saint, might in "merrie time" of old induce a
  little festivity.</p>

  procure at any chemist's establishment a solution of gutta percha in
  chloroform, which may answer the purpose required by him. It is used by
  medical men as a dressing for abrasion in the skin of bed-ridden persons,
  and is applied with a camel's-hair brush. It hardens on being applied,
  and produces an artificial skin, which saves the patient from farther
  suffering in the place to which it has been applied.</p>

  <p>Naphtha will render gutta percha soluble; and if needed to be used as
  a varnish, it is only necessary to make a solution in a closed vessel,
  and apply it with a brush. The naphtha will evaporate and leave a thin
  coating of firmly-adhering gutta percha behind.</p>

  your correspondent <span class="sc">G. Taylor</span> supposes was
  suggested by the inn at Brentford, mentioned by <span class="sc">Dr.
  Rimbault</span>. The American biographer says that Goldsmith and his
  companion Bryanton</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Got up a country club at the inn at Ballymahon, of which Goldsmith
  soon became the oracle and prime wit; astonishing his unlettered
  associates by his learning, and being considered capital at a song and
  story. From the rustic conviviality of the inn at Ballymahon, and the
  company which used to assemble there, it is surmised that he took some
  hints in afterlife for his picturing of Tony Lumpkin and his associates,
  'Dick Muggins the exciseman, Jack Slang the horse doctor, Little Aminadab
  that grinds the music-box, and Tom Twist that spins the pewter-platter.'
  Nay, it is thought that Tony's drinking-song at the 'Three Jolly Pigeons'
  was but a revival of one of the convivial catches at Ballymahon."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And the author farther remarks, that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Though Goldsmith ultimately rose to associate with birds of a finer
  feather, his heart would still yearn in secret after the 'Three Jolly
  Pigeons.'"</p>

  reference to Crofton Croker's <i>Researches in the South of Ireland</i>,
  p. 160., whence the paragraph (unacknowledged) was introduced into <i>The
  Dublin Penny Journal</i>. Mr. Croker, moreover, fell into error with
  respect to the dates of these curious enactments, which were long

  <p><i>The Passion of our Lord dramatised</i> (Vol. ix., p. 373.).&mdash;A
  drama on the <i>Passion of Christ</i> (the first specimen of the kind
  that has descended to our days) is attributed to St. Gregory of
  Nazianzum, but is more probably the production of Gregory of Antioch
  (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 572). It is described by most of the
  ecclesiastical writers: Tillemont, Baillet, Baronius, Bellarmin, Dupin,
  Vossius, Rivet, Labbæus, Ceillier, Fleury, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In 1486, when <i>La Mistère de la Passion</i>, or the Passion of our
  Saviour, was exhibited at Antwerp, the beholders were astonished by
  <i>five</i> different scaffolds, each having several stages rising
  perpendicularly: paradise was the most elevated, and it had two stages.
  But even this display was eclipsed by another exhibition of <i>The
  Passion</i>, where no fewer than <i>nine</i> scaffolds were displayed to
  the wondering gaze of the people.</p>

  <p>In 1556, according to Strype (<i>Life of Sir Thos. Pope</i>, Pref. p.
  vii.), the <i>Passion of Christ</i> was represented at the Grey Friers in
  London, on Corpus Christi Day, before the Lord Mayor, the Privy Council,
  and many great persons of the realm. Again, the same historian informs us
  (<i>Ecclesiastical Memorials</i>, iii. c. xlix.) under the date 1557:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The <i>Passion of Christ</i> was acted at the Grey Friers on the day
  that war was proclaimed against France, and in honour of that
  occasion."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 529 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page529"></a>{529}</span></p>

  <p>It is generally considered that the last miracle play represented in
  England was that of <i>Christ's Passion</i>, in the reign of James I.,
  which Prynne informs us was&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Performed at Elie House in Holborne, when Gondomar lay there, on Good
  Friday at night, at which there were thousands present."</p>

  <p>Busby's idea, "that the manner of reciting and singing in the theatres

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Edward F. Rimbault.</span></p>

  <p>It is said that Apollonarius of Laodicea (<span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  362), and Gregory of Nazianzum not much later, dramatised our Lord's
  Passion. Many, however, regard the <i>Christus Patiens</i>, ascribed to
  Gregory, as spurious. The Passion of our Lord was represented in the
  Coliseum at Rome as much as six centuries ago. The subject was a
  favourite one in Italy. In France, "The Fraternity of the Passion of our
  Saviour" received letters patent from Charles VI. in 1402. Their object
  was to perform moralities or mysteries, <i>i. e.</i> plays on sacred
  subjects. In 1486, the Chapter of the Church at Lyons gave sixty livres
  to those who had played the mystery of the Passion of our Lord Jesus
  Christ. In 1518, Francis I. confirmed by letters patent the privileges of
  the Confrères de la Passion: one of their pieces, reprinted in 1541, is
  entitled <i>Le Mystère de la Passion de N.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;C.</i> The same subject
  was common in Spain and Germany. In England the Coventry mysteries,
  &amp;c. partook of the same character. The Cotton MS. (Vespasian, b.
  viii.) and the Chester Whitsun plays (Harleian MS. 2013.) would probably
  afford information which I cannot now give. So late as 1640, Sandys wrote
  a tragedy, on a plan furnished by Grotius, upon Christ's Passion. A
  little research would give H. P. a number of similar facts.</p>

  and was reprinted in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> for January, 1835. It
  commences thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Whence comes the wavering light which falls</p>
      <p>On Langdale's lonely Chapel-walls?</p>
      <p>The noble mother of Christobell</p>
      <p>Lies in that lone and drear chapelle."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Query, What is known of the history and authorship of this poem?</p>

  <p>It will be observed from the dates, that the <i>sequel</i> appeared in
  print before Christabel was published by Coleridge.</p>

  <p class="author">J. M. B.</p>

  <p><i>Garrick's Funeral Epigram</i> (Vol. vii., p. 619.).&mdash;Bishop
  Horne was, I believe, the author of these verses; at least I have seen
  them in a volume published by him, entitled (I think)
  <i>Miscellanies</i>: and I think they are stated to be his in Jones'
  <i>Life of Horne</i>. But I have neither work at this moment before me to
